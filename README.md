**Utsuwa is an open-source AI companion with 3D VRM avatars.** A platform where you can have a virtual companion that learns and grows with you, bundled with optional mechanics inspired by Japanese [dating sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_sim) games. Utsuwa is privacy-focused: your data is stored locally and never leaves your device.

"Utsuwa" means "vessel" in Japanese. A container for AI to inhabit visually.

</p>

## Features

- **VRM Model Viewer**: Load and display VRM 3D avatar models with orbit controls, automatic camera framing per model, and live camera settings (zoom, height, field of view)
- **Developer Tools**: Test VRM facial expressions and animations, or upload a temporary `.vrm` file for a non-persistent preview that reverts when you leave the page
- **AR Mode**: On WebXR-capable devices (Android Chrome, headset browsers), place your companion on your real floor, drag her around, and pinch to resize
- **Photo Mode**: Pose her from a pose library, set her expression, pick a background, add a color filter, vignette, or frame, drop draggable stickers on the shot, and capture in high resolution with a quick snap or self-timer. Head tracking keeps her eyes on your camera while she holds the pose
- **Touch Reactions**: Tap her and she reacts with an expression and a physics ripple through hair and clothes. Reactions depend on where you tap and how close the two of you are
- **Scene Backgrounds**: Swap the backdrop behind her for pastel gradients or cute patterns (dots, hearts, sparkles, stripes, gingham) right from the Controls panel; your pick persists
- **Physics Intensity**: A Movement slider from Subtle to Lively scales how much her hair and outfit respond to motion, respecting each model's own rig tuning
- **Model-Centric UI**: Full-screen 3D model with unobtrusive overlay controls
- **3D Speech Bubbles**: Chat responses appear as bubbles that track the model's head in 3D space, revealed word by word at a configurable speed
- **Chat Window**: Optional messenger-style floating window with the full conversation history and the input docked inside; drag it anywhere, resize from any edge, snap it left or right. Display modes (Immersive, Chat window, Both, Off) live in Settings > Display
- **Thinking Status**: A shimmer label narrates what she is actually doing (Remembering, Looking at your photo, Thinking), with a configurable delay and an optional soft audio ping
- **Chat Interface**: Floating input bar (left, center, or right aligned) with streaming responses
- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text via a local Whisper server (Speaches, faster-whisper-server, whisper.cpp), Groq (Whisper), or the browser's Web Speech API, with real-time audio visualization
- **Show Her Photos**: Show your companion an image via the attach (paperclip) button in the chat bar or drag-and-drop. Vision-capable models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, or local ones like LLaVA) actually see it and can remember the moment, and kept photos live on a scrapbook-style board. Images stay on your device and only ever reach vision-capable models
- **LLM Integration**: Support for 8 LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, LM Studio, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Together, vLLM, ...)
- **Local Model Discovery**: Ollama and LM Studio discover installed local models directly from your device
- **Text-to-Speech**: Support for ElevenLabs and OpenAI TTS, local voices via any OpenAI-compatible server (Kokoro-FastAPI, openedai-speech), and local OmniVoice. Sentences are fetched in parallel with playback so gaps between sentences stay short
- **Fully Local Option**: Run the whole stack offline — local LLM (Ollama/LM Studio), local TTS, and local Whisper STT — so nothing leaves your device
- **Lip-sync**: Audio-driven mouth animation synced to TTS playback
- **Animations**: VRMA-based idle and talking animations with automatic blinking
- **Character Customization**: Customize your companion's name, personality, and system prompt
- **Avatar Tasks & Timers**: Your companion can schedule reminders for itself, e.g. to check back with you later. Fired and missed timers appear in the reminder dropdown (bell icon) so you can see what happened and dismiss them. Reminders persist across browser reloads and stay in sync between the main app and the desktop overlay
- **Companion System**: Multi-axis relationship tracking with mood, events, and semantic memory
- **Semantic Memory**: Local AI-powered memory search using Transformers.js - finds memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Memory Graph**: Interactive visualization showing how memories connect semantically
- **Data Export/Import**: Download your data as a save file, restore anytime
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode support with system preference detection
- **Desktop App** *(beta)*: Native desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux with transparent overlay mode, so your companion floats on your desktop

### Local-First Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB:
- No database setup required
- Works offline after initial load
- Export/import save files to back up or transfer your data
- Settings > Data to manage your save files

### Companion System

Build a meaningful relationship with your AI companion through a dating sim-inspired progression system:

- **Multi-axis Relationships**: Track affection, trust, intimacy, comfort, and respect separately
- **8 Relationship Stages**: Progress from Stranger → Acquaintance → Friend → Close Friend → Romantic Interest → Dating → Committed → Soulmate
- **Dynamic Mood**: Real-time emotions with causality tracking (she remembers *why* she feels a certain way)
- **Visual Novel Events**: Milestone moments, romantic scenes, and choices that matter - with custom dialogue and branching responses
- **Semantic Memory**: Facts are indexed with vector embeddings for meaning-based retrieval - "outdoor activities" finds memories about hiking. Runs locally using Transformers.js, no API calls
- **Natural Progression**: Hybrid system combining app heuristics + LLM suggestions for believable relationship growth
- **Time-Aware**: Your companion notices when you've been away and reacts accordingly
- **Scheduled Tasks**: The companion can set timers/reminders for itself. Timers that fired while the app was closed are marked as missed and shown in the reminder dropdown for you to review and dismiss. The list survives a browser reload and is kept in sync across the main app and overlay windows

See the [Companion System Architecture](https://docs.utsuwa.ai/technology/companion-system) for full details.

### Desktop Application (Beta)

A native desktop app (`crates/app-host`, Rust + WebView) that runs the same SvelteKit frontend — your save files are compatible with the web version. It works on X11/XWayland and native Wayland, and additionally exposes the agent runtime (model chat, tools, plugins, memory) to the UI over a typed IPC bridge.

## Supported Providers

### LLM Providers (8)

Utsuwa supports popular cloud and local LLMs. For endpoints that speak the OpenAI API (OpenRouter, Together, vLLM, LiteLLM, etc.), use the **OpenAI-Compatible** provider:
- Set the **Base URL** to the endpoint root (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1/`).
- **API Key** is optional; leave it empty for keyless local servers.
- Enter a model manually or fetch available models after providing a base URL.
- **Advanced Parameters** (temperature, top-p, max tokens, presence/frequency penalties) are passed to the endpoint when set.

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, xAI (Grok) |
| **Local** | Ollama, LM Studio |
| **OpenAI-Compatible** | OpenRouter, Together, vLLM, LiteLLM, etc. |

#### Context Window and Memory Budget

The **Context Window** setting is available for every LLM provider. When enabled, it tells Utsuwa how many tokens the selected model can process. The app then:

- Retrieves the matching number of recent conversation turns from working memory.
- Scales the amount of injected memory (recent conversation turns and relevant facts) to match the window size.
- Truncates older chat history before sending, always keeping the system prompt and the user's newest message.

If the setting is left off, Utsuwa keeps the historical defaults (10 retrieved turns, 6 injected turns, 5 facts) and does not truncate history. This is useful when you want the provider to handle its own context management.

### TTS Providers (4)

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud** | ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS |
| **Local** | Local TTS (Kokoro-FastAPI, openedai-speech, any OpenAI-compatible server), OmniVoice |

OmniVoice is a fully local text-to-speech option that runs on your own GPU or CPU. It supports both built-in synthetic voices and custom voice clones, covers many languages, and can switch between two voices on demand for bilingual replies. Sentences are fetched in parallel during playback to keep gaps short. See [OmniVoice Setup](https://docs.utsuwa.ai/docs/guides/omnivoice) for installation instructions.

### STT Providers (4)

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Local** | Local STT (Speaches, faster-whisper-server, whisper.cpp, any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` server) |
| **Cloud** | Groq (Whisper), OpenAI (Whisper) |
| **Browser** | Web Speech API (no API key required) |

Voice input is accessed via the microphone button in the chat bar. Selection is automatic by priority: a configured local Whisper server wins, then Groq, then OpenAI, then the browser's Web Speech API. A local server or a cloud key works on any platform including desktop; Web Speech API works without an API key in Chrome, Edge, and Safari. See [Local STT Setup](https://docs.utsuwa.ai/docs/guides/local-stt-setup) to run a local Whisper server.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> Utsuwa is in its very early development stages. If you're using the app, **save your data often**. Early versions may not have backwards-compatible save states and could require manual reformatting.
