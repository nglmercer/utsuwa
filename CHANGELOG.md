# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Procedural pose convention for VRM0/VRM1**: all body programs (sit/stand, walk/run swing, bow, nod, shrug) now pose through a `HumanoidMotionBasis` with semantic operations (`thighForward`, `kneeFlex`, `footPitch`, ...) instead of raw Euler signs. Previously the fixed signs were anatomically reversed on VRM0 models — which includes all three shipped models — producing backward knees when sitting. Sit is now a real pose (thighs ~77°, knee interior ~97°, leveled feet, upright spine), and shrug is symmetric (it previously lifted one arm inward).
- **Sit/stand posture transitions**: idempotent sit/stand (no re-measure lift, no fake crouch), baseline-interpolated root/weight so mid-transition reversals glide, cancel/stopKind restore the origin posture (no more sinking into the floor), and seated walk/run/goto/jump play the stand transition first instead of teleporting upright.
- **VRM0 facing normalization** uses the official `VRMUtils.rotateVRM0()` helper (behavior-identical to the previous manual scene rotation, unknown versions keep the VRM0-facing default).

### Added
- **Persisted execution receipts with idempotent replay**: every tool-step attempt records an `ExecutionReceipt` in `tasks.db` (schema v2, v1 databases migrate on open). A retry whose earlier attempt already succeeded replays the stored output instead of re-invoking the tool, so a crash between "effect fired" and "step completed" no longer double-fires side effects; timeouts record `unknown_outcome`, failures stay audit-only.
- **Crash/restart fault suites**: `task-core` and `task-host` integration tests drop file-backed stores mid-state and assert recovery after reopen (stale leases requeue, waits resume and expire, receipts survive, one tool effect fires exactly once across a simulated crash).
- **Generic model-facing `tasks.create`**: the default agent can now create any durable task from an explicit step list (one-shot, multi-step, scheduled), with up-front plan validation; `tasks.create_interval` stays the path for plain repetitions.
- **Task Center (Settings → Tasks)**: lifecycle filters, per-step progress, attempts, errors, and approve/reject/cancel actions over the same `task.*` IPC the daemon and model tools use.
- **`task-cli daemon` for closed-app execution**: runs the tick loop plus worker pool headlessly against the shared `tasks.db` until Ctrl-C, printing terminal results and reporting (or, with `--yes`, approving) parked reviews. Exactly one driver at a time — never alongside the app.
- **Model-gate aging and fairness metrics**: background turns are admitted despite queued interactive turns after 8 consecutive interactive admissions or 30s of waiting, and `snapshot()` exposes per-kind admissions plus total/max queueing waits.
- **CI `durable-tasks` job**: explicit per-PR signal for the task suites plus a no-network `task-cli` smoke test (submit, list, timings, daemon startup).
- **Agent tool-profile selector in Settings**: the native agent's tool surface (`minimal` … `full`) is now user-configurable from the desktop Settings panel and persists via `settings.set`. Smaller profiles answer simple requests noticeably faster (a trivial Kilo request dropped from ~17 s wall-clock on 131 tools to ~10 s on 64 tools in local testing); the default stays `full` for cloud / `simple` for local providers.
- **Per-request timing diagnostics**: `--debug` turn logs now report time-to-first-content and total stream time per model request plus per-iteration timings, so the next slow turn shows exactly where wall-clock time went.

### Fixed
- **Stalled provider streams can no longer hang a turn forever**: both model clients bound the response-headers wait and the mid-stream idle window to 60 s (any arriving SSE bytes, including keep-alive comments, reset the window). A stall fails the turn with an actionable message instead of waiting silently; slow-but-healthy streams are unaffected.

### Changed
- **Model capabilities are now discovered from real provider APIs instead of model-name heuristics**: a new `model-catalog` service resolves every model through its provider's actual `/models` endpoint (Kilo/OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible, LM Studio with `/api/v1` → `/api/v0` → `/v1` fallbacks, Ollama `/api/tags` + `/api/show`, Anthropic/Google list endpoints), normalizing `architecture.input_modalities` and `supported_parameters` into explicit supported/unsupported/unknown states. All `VISION_MODEL_HINTS` / `TEXT_ONLY_MODELS` substring lists and `gpt-* = vision`-style provider assumptions are gone on both sides of the bridge; silent catalog entries resolve to Unknown and safely degrade to text/tool fallback instead of erroring with `No endpoints found that support image input`. Stale advertisements self-heal: an explicit provider capability rejection suppresses the capability, invalidates the cached catalog, and retries once without the rejected media. `model-cli --vision` is now `auto` (API-discovered, the default) with `on`/`off` as debug overrides, and the CLI prints the resolved `capabilities_source` plus per-modality states before each run.

### Fixed
- **Wayland screenshots work even when PipeWire capture delivers no frames**: one-shot captures (`desktop.screenshot`) now go through the XDG Screenshot portal first — one D-Bus round trip, no streaming negotiation, natively compressed PNG — and only fall back to ScreenCast + PipeWire where the Screenshot portal is missing (or when an explicit `max_width` resize is requested, which only PipeWire can negotiate). PipeWire stream errors now surface with their cause instead of a bare 5-second timeout, and the timeout message points at the likely grant/format culprits.
- **The scary `Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime` panic on the agent thread is gone**: the `keyring` crate's blocking D-Bus client panics on any thread holding a Tokio context — including `spawn_blocking` workers — and the keychain probe hit it on every screenshot attempt (caught, but noisy, and it silently disabled the real keychain so ScreenCast restore tokens never persisted). Every keychain operation now hops to a dedicated plain OS thread first, so the OS keychain actually works from async workers and screen-share approvals persist across runs.
- The per-turn tool catalog no longer registers `system.time` twice (builtin pack plus `tool-system` pack), removing the `duplicate tool id; keeping first` warning on every turn. The builtin pack remains the single owner with full local/UTC clock facts.
- **Agent turns no longer die silently on Linux when the OS keychain is involved**: reading the model API key from the Secret Service ran on a Tokio async worker, which panics (`Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime`) and left the chat spinning forever with no error. Keychain reads now run on the blocking pool, a worker panic always resolves the turn as `agent.turn_failed` instead of hanging the UI, finished turns park their worker handle, and cancelling an idle runtime stays silent instead of emitting a phantom `agent.turn_cancelled`.
- **The Linux desktop app opens again**: WebKitGTK 2.46+ refuses top-level navigation to custom schemes that aren't registered as CORS-enabled, and wry 0.56.1 only registers them as secure — so the bundled app sat on a blank window. The host now applies the missing registration itself (no fork), and startup is checkpoint-logged under `--debug` so any future boot failure points at its stage.
- **The Linux app no longer freezes a few seconds after loading**: every screen-sharing status poll created and dropped a fresh AT-SPI connection, and the second creation hangs forever upstream. The host now holds one shared, timeout-guarded registry connection, and desktop IPC dispatches off the UI thread, so a blocking OS round-trip can never deadlock the main loop again.
- The desktop CSP no longer blocks its own theme script (it lives in an external file now), and frontend crashes surface in the host log instead of failing silently.
- Fresh installs no longer download the ONNX embedding model at every startup when no memory facts exist; semantic recall still warms it on demand.
- A dead WebKit renderer no longer looks like a frozen app: the host now detects web-process termination, logs the reason, and shows a diagnostic page instead of a stuck window. Startup diagnostics also report the loaded WebKitGTK runtime version, and the asset server is integration-tested against the real native bundle when one is present.
- **Vision-capable models actually receive screen pixels now**: the native agent classified every OpenAI-compatible model as text-only, so screenshots degraded to metadata text. The host now takes the frontend's vision classification as explicit configuration (falling back to a provider/model-name heuristic when unset), Wayland capture keeps only the newest frame instead of a stale FIFO, PipeWire negotiates CPU-readable buffers so DMA-BUF stops dropping frames, stopping a share no longer deletes images an in-flight request still needs, and `desktop.observe` returns one fresh image per call — reusing the active Share Screen or taking one screenshot.
- `media.video_keyframes` no longer reports success with zero frames: sparse undecodable timestamps are skipped in favor of later ones, and a video with no decodable frame returns an explicit error.
- New `model-cli` headless binary (`cargo run -p app-host --bin model-cli -- --ask "..."`) for testing questions against real models through the full agent stack. Defaults to the Kilo gateway free model with isolated temp state, streams the answer plus tool activity, and handles permission requests interactively or via `--yes`; `--profile` shrinks the tool surface for small models.
- Provider adapters now send spec-legal tool names (dots become underscores, mapped back per request), fixing HTTP 400 rejections from strict gateways such as Kilo/Poolside.
- The agent loop retries transient provider failures (429/408/5xx) with exponential backoff instead of failing the turn on the first rate limit; fatal errors still surface immediately. Wayland portal capture approval is bounded (120s) so an unanswered OS screen-share dialog fails the tool call instead of hanging the turn forever.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- **Your ElevenLabs voice is actually yours now**: the custom Voice ID box was saving to a setting the speech pipeline never read, so everyone heard the default voice no matter what they pasted. The field now drives the voice that plays, offers the built-in voices as suggestions, carries over any ID you had already entered, and a wrong ID tells you so instead of quietly falling back. Reported by @Jessika07.
- The TTS model dropdown no longer forgets your selection every time you open the tab.
- **Download Save File works in the desktop app**: it writes the file straight into your Downloads folder and shows you the filename. A brand-new profile also could not export at all, on web or desktop; that is fixed too.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Design your OmniVoice voice**: OmniVoice grew a proper settings panel. Pick a language and a preset voice side by side, or describe the voice you want by gender, age, pitch, and accent and let it build one. Sliders for speed and synthesis quality, a Test button that speaks a phrase in the active language, and a Regenerate button when a voice drifts and you want a fresh one. Voices now keep a persistent profile, so the speaker sounds like the same person from sentence to sentence instead of shifting between takes. You can also clone a voice from a few seconds of reference audio, manage your clones, and switch between synthetic and cloned modes. Contributed by @dezihh.

### Fixed
- **She speaks on iPhones again**: iOS Safari requires audio to start inside your tap, and her voice arrived just late enough to be refused, silently. The audio pipeline now unlocks the moment you hit send, so TTS works on iOS for every provider. One thing the fix cannot do: if the ring/silent switch is on, iOS mutes her anyway. Check the switch before assuming she has nothing to say.
- Animation files are fetched once and reused instead of being downloaded again on every idle cycle. Less network chatter, quicker transitions.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **OmniVoice, a local voice that speaks a lot of languages**: a new keyless TTS provider that runs entirely on your own machine, no cloud account and no API key. Pick it under Settings > Speech (TTS), choose one of thirteen preset voices, set a language and a speed, and she talks. It needs a small proxy you run yourself, which ships in `tools/omnivoice` with a Docker setup for both NVIDIA and CPU machines. The [setup guide](/docs/guides/omnivoice) walks through it. An NVIDIA GPU makes it quick; CPU works but takes its time. Contributed by @dezihh.
- **You can see whether your local voice server is awake**: local TTS providers now show a small green or red dot in the provider dropdown, so you know at a glance whether the thing on the other end is actually running before you send a message and wait for silence. Contributed by @dezihh.

### Changed
- The OmniVoice proxy listens on port 8881 rather than 8880, so it can sit alongside a Kokoro or openedai-speech server without the two fighting over the same address.
- The OmniVoice proxy is published on localhost only. It has no password and accepts requests from anywhere, so it stays on your machine unless you deliberately open it up. The setup guide shows the one-line change if you want to reach it from another device, and what you are agreeing to when you do.

### Fixed
- Docker Desktop users on Mac and Windows can reach the OmniVoice proxy now. The old container setup used a networking mode that only ever worked on Linux and quietly did nothing everywhere else.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-19

### License
- Utsuwa is now licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Everything you could do before you can still do: use it, change it, self-host it, share it. The one new rule is for people who ship a modified Utsuwa to others, including as a hosted service: their changes have to stay open too. Releases up to 0.12.0 remain MIT.

### Added
- **The chat window grew up**: the old sidebar is now a proper messenger-style window with the input docked inside it. Type where you read. Drag it anywhere by the header, resize it from any edge or corner, snap it to either side, and it remembers exactly where you left it. On phones it opens low on the screen so her face stays in view above the conversation. If it ever ends up somewhere off screen, a Reset position button in Settings > Display brings it home.
- **She tells you what she is doing**: the typing dots are gone. While a reply is in flight you now see a soft shimmer that narrates the actual step, Remembering while she digs through your history, Looking at your photo when you have shown her one, and Thinking while she writes. No fake theatre, the labels follow the real pipeline.
- **Replies reveal word by word**: her messages fade in a word at a time instead of appearing all at once, in the bubble and in the chat window. Pick the pace (or turn it off) under Settings > Display > Text Reveal. Respects reduced-motion preferences.
- **She reacts when you move the camera**: orbiting or whipping the camera around now sends a ripple through her hair, clothes, and anything else with physics, in the main view and in photo mode. Her body stays planted, only the soft parts swing. The existing Movement slider scales the effect.
- **Floating bar placement**: the input bar can sit left, center, or right along the bottom edge, under Settings > Display > Floating Bar.

### Changed
- The display modes have new names: Immersive (bubble by her head), Chat window, Both, and Off. Your saved preference carries over unchanged.
- Typing a long message now trails forward on a single line instead of stacking rows, in both the floating bar and the chat window.
- The input bar and mood button moved to the softer gray surface from the design system, and the bar holds its exact size when you switch between typing and voice input.
- The Display settings page was cleaned up to match its siblings: borderless panels and the same toggle switch used everywhere else.

### Fixed
- Resizing the chat window after closing and reopening it no longer fights you. Resize now works from every edge and corner, and the window re-clamps itself when your browser window changes size.
- Dragging a photo in while the chat window is open now highlights the window itself instead of a ghost of the hidden floating bar.
- The floating bar no longer shifts off center when opening the companion status tray.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Dedicated settings pages for LLM, TTS, and STT**: AI service configuration moved out of the Character page into three focused pages in the settings sidebar, so finding the model picker no longer means scrolling past persona settings. The refresh button next to the model list now always refetches from the provider instead of serving a cached list. Contributed by @dezihh.
- **Typing indicator delay and wait tone**: two new options under Settings > Display > Typing Indicator. Set a delay so the typing dots only appear when a reply is actually taking a while, and optionally enable a soft two-note ping that plays while she is thinking. Both are off by default. Contributed by @dezihh.

### Changed
- **She starts speaking sooner**: long replies are now synthesized and spoken sentence by sentence instead of as one block, so the first sentence can play while the rest is still being generated. For cloud voices this means a few smaller TTS requests per reply instead of one large one, capped at two at a time to stay inside provider concurrency limits. If a sentence fails to synthesize, the rest still plays and the error surfaces as a toast instead of being swallowed. This also lays the groundwork for streaming TTS providers in a future release. Contributed by @dezihh.
- CI now runs a full production build alongside type checks and tests, so build-only failures cannot slip through green checks.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Chat history sidebar**: a floating, draggable, resizable panel with the full conversation, with display modes (bubble, sidebar, both, or off) and a new Settings > Display page. Drag it by the header, resize from the corner, snap it to either edge; position and size persist. In sidebar-only mode a closed panel reopens when she starts responding so a reply is never missed. Contributed by @dezihh.

### Fixed
- Photos taken in Photo Mode on the desktop app now land in your Downloads folder, the same place the web app puts them. Previously desktop captures were saved only to internal storage with nothing visible to show for it.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Photo Mode**: the camera button now opens a full photo mode instead of taking an instant screenshot. Pose her from a growing pose library, set her expression, pick a background, add a color filter, vignette, or a polaroid or film frame, drop draggable stickers on the shot, and capture at high resolution with a quick snap or a 3 second self-timer. A compact tabbed panel keeps every control in the corner, out of your shot, and everything you see in the preview is exactly what the saved photo looks like. Head tracking is in there too: toggle it on and she follows your camera with her eyes and chin while she holds a pose.
- **Reminders and timers**: ask her to remind you of something ("remind me in 10 minutes to stretch") and she will schedule it, bring it up when it fires, and notice timers that came due while the app was closed. Pending and fired reminders live in a new alarm dropdown in the top bar. Works across the main app and the desktop overlay. Contributed by @dezihh.
- **She reacts to touch**: tap her, in the regular view or in photo mode, and she responds with an expression and a little physics ripple through her hair and clothes. How she reacts depends on where you tap and how close the two of you are: early on she is easily flustered, and the warmer reactions are something you earn.
- **Scene backgrounds**: the backdrop behind her is yours to change now, in the Controls panel. Pastel gradients like Sakura, Peach, and Lavender, and cute patterns like polka dots, hearts, sparkles, candy stripes, and gingham. Your pick sticks across restarts, and photos taken in Room mode capture it faithfully.
- **Physics intensity**: a Movement slider in the Controls panel, from Subtle to Lively, scales how much her hair, skirt, and everything else the model author rigged responds to motion. Every model keeps its own tuning; the slider just turns the dial.

### Fixed
- Spring-bone physics no longer explodes after a tab refocus or a long window drag; the worst frame the physics ever sees is now a calm one.
- Fired reminders no longer count as you interacting: they cannot advance the relationship, reset the away-time clock, or plant memories, and the "last time you talked" recap works again after every restart.

### Changed
- **Reminder system is now multi-window aware**: the main app and desktop overlay coordinate fired timers via `BroadcastChannel`, so the alarm icon updates on every open surface. The LLM reaction still runs exactly once, handled by the window that atomically claims the reminder.
- **Fired and missed reminders now survive a browser reload**: reminders stay in the alarm dropdown until you dismiss them; the dismissed state is persisted in IndexedDB.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Temporary VRM preview in Developer Tools**: upload a .vrm file and preview it in the viewport without saving anything. The model lives in memory only, and your real avatar returns automatically when you leave the page or click Restore Original. Contributed by @dezihh.

### Fixed
- With a Context Window configured, an oversized message in chat history (a large paste, for example) no longer slips through truncation and overflows the model's window. The message that breaks the budget is now dropped along with everything older, while your newest message is always kept.

### Changed
- The landing page now shows AR mode among the feature callouts, with a real capture from an Android device.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible endpoints, first class**: the OpenAI-Compatible provider now discovers models from your endpoint automatically (including a local Ollama), offers them in a searchable dropdown, and exposes advanced parameters: temperature, top P, max tokens, and presence and frequency penalties. Contributed by @dezihh.
- **Context window control**: a new Context Window setting in AI Services and onboarding, for every LLM provider. When enabled, memory injection scales to your model's window (small local models get a lean memory layer, larger models get more turns and facts) and older chat history is trimmed so prompts fit, always keeping the persona and your newest message. Leave it off and behavior is unchanged. Also contributed by @dezihh: this release ships our first community contributions, thank you.

### Fixed
- Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints: a base URL entered without /v1 now works for chat, not just the model dropdown, and keyless endpoints no longer receive a fabricated Authorization header that strict gateways rejected.
- Switching TTS providers no longer carries the previous provider's voice along, which could make the new provider fail silently with a voice it doesn't know. The voice now resets to the new provider's default, and playback failures show a brief message naming the actual problem instead of the companion just going quiet.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **She notices the distance now**: if the relationship weakens after a long absence, the stage no longer silently drops. Small dips hold steady, and a real drift is acknowledged in a new "Growing Apart" conversation where she tells you how it feels and you choose how to respond.
- **Memory that speaks your language**: the on-device memory model is now multilingual, so companions remember and recall properly in Japanese, Korean, Russian, and more, not just English. Existing memories re-index themselves automatically (see note below).
- **Chatting in other languages now counts**: messages written in non-Latin scripts previously barely moved the relationship because the mechanics only understood English. The model's own read of the conversation now carries full weight for those messages.

### Fixed
- Declining the confession no longer permanently blocks relationship progression, and the main and overlay windows no longer overwrite each other's progress.
- Opening the app during the second day of an absence no longer swallows the reunion: time-away effects now apply when you actually return, not to a moment that didn't count.
- Streaks survive daylight-saving transitions and device clock changes, and apologizing to your companion no longer reads as negativity.
- Repeated observations merge into one memory instead of filling the memory book with near-duplicates, so recall stays sharp over long relationships.
- Event popups fixed: no more dead click zone on dialogue and no crash when closing at the wrong moment.

### Changed
- Smoother streaming replies and faster startup for collections with several custom avatars.
- The character settings page was rebuilt from one 2,300-line file into focused sections, with identical behavior.
- Every change now runs the full test suite (197 tests) and type checks in CI before it can merge.

### Note for existing users
On your first launch after this update, Utsuwa downloads the new multilingual memory model (about 100 MB, one time, cached after that) and re-indexes your saved memories in the background. Everything keeps working during the re-index; memory recall briefly leans on keyword matching until it finishes.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Camera that fits itself**: the camera now frames each model by its actual proportions on load (head near the top of the screen, crop around the thigh), so tall and short models both land well without any adjustment.
- **Live camera settings**: zoom, height, and field-of-view sliders in a popover that adjusts the scene in real time, with a reset back to the fitted default. No more settings-page roundtrips. Settings persist, and your old camera-distance preference migrates automatically.
- **Settings cluster**: the top-right button expands into a tidy column holding the settings pages, camera controls, the theme toggle (now a single cycling button: system, light, dark), and AR.
- **AR mode (WebXR)**: on Android Chrome and headset browsers, place your companion on your real floor with camera passthrough: she auto-places via floor detection, one finger drags her around, two fingers pinch to resize, and the chat UI stays visible. On devices without WebXR (including iPhones), the AR button opens a guide instead.
- **Overlay resize and lock**: hover the desktop overlay for a soft frame, drag the top-left corner tab to resize the window (your size is remembered), and lock her position so clicks can't drag the window.
- **Overlay camera profile**: overlay mode keeps its own zoom/height/FOV settings, independent of the main app, adjustable from the new hover rail.

### Changed
- **Overlay speech is readable now**: replies appear in a docked dialog bubble above the bottom controls instead of chasing the head of a window that itself moves.
- The Display settings page was removed; its two controls (theme and camera) moved into the settings cluster.

### Fixed
- **Overlay hover framerate drop**: hovering the overlay ran an expensive model raycast on every mouse movement for a feature that was disabled; it's gone, and hover no longer stutters (this was most noticeable on Windows).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **Viewer scene overhaul**: a clean, minimal stage for your companion — single white key light with tone mapping disabled so MToon models render with their authored colors, pure-white (light) / near-black (dark) backdrop with a soft studio floor, and free orbit controls with unrestricted pan and zoom.
- **New default avatars**: Tsuki, Yuki, and Momo (VRoid Project sample models) replace the previous bundled model. Each model's license is documented in `static/models/README.md`.

### Fixed
- **Model thumbnails no longer flip between T-pose renders and portraits**: previews now consistently use the model's embedded thumbnail, and generation no longer races storage restore on startup.
- **Readable error when an OpenAI-compatible base URL points at a website**: instead of a wall of raw HTML, chat now shows a short hint to double-check the base URL.

### Added
- **Privacy Policy and Terms of Use** pages on the website, linked from the footer.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Onboarding now configures OpenAI-compatible endpoints**: selecting the OpenAI-Compatible provider during setup showed no fields to fill in. It now offers an optional API key, a base URL, and a model, and won't let you continue until a base URL and model are set.

### Added
- **Voice input during onboarding**: a new optional Voice Input (STT) step lets you set up a local Whisper server, Groq, or OpenAI while getting started, matching what the settings page already offered.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint**: point Utsuwa at any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenRouter, Together, Mistral, Perplexity, a local vLLM, LiteLLM, and more) with a base URL, an optional API key, and a model of your choice.
- **Local speech-to-text**: run voice input entirely on your machine with any OpenAI-compatible Whisper server (Speaches, faster-whisper-server, whisper.cpp). Audio never leaves your device, and there's no API key or per-minute cost. Includes a new Local STT Setup guide.
- **OpenAI (Whisper) speech-to-text**: OpenAI's cloud Whisper is now a voice-input option alongside Groq, a local server, and the browser's Web Speech API.
- **Developer animation preview**: the animation dropdown in the developer panel now lists the bundled emote clips so you can trigger them directly.

### Fixed
- **Relationship progression no longer stalls at Romantic Interest**: accepting a milestone moment (such as the confession) now correctly advances the stage, so Dating, Committed, and Soulmate are reachable.
- **Conversations are remembered**: chat turns and sessions now persist to local storage, so your companion's history and memory survive reloads.
- **Time-away handling**: the once-per-absence mood and relationship decay no longer stacks up on load, so returning after a break feels natural rather than punishing.
- **Save import is now atomic** and de-duplicates on merge, so importing a backup can no longer half-apply or create duplicate facts, sessions, or events.
- **Cleaner replies and overlay parity**: fixed a case where truncated model output could leak raw JSON into dialogue, and the desktop overlay now uses the same response pipeline as the main app.
- Onboarding starts from a friendly default persona, no longer closes when you click inside it, and restores your saved relationship stage without downgrading it.
- A range of smaller fixes and dead-code cleanup from a full code audit (hotkey handling, TTS model and speed handling, response streaming, and several avatar and memory edge cases).

### Security
- **SSRF protection**: the hosted API blocks requests to private, loopback, and cloud-metadata addresses made through client-supplied provider URLs.
- Release workflow actions are pinned to commit SHAs.

### Changed
- Consolidated provider default base URLs and the companion-turn pipeline into single shared sources to reduce drift.
- Refreshed the README and documentation (STT options, provider list, roadmap, and acknowledgments) to match the current app.

> Versions 0.5.x and 0.6.x shipped without changelog entries during a rapid iteration stretch; everything from that window is summarized in the 0.7.0 notes above.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Local text-to-speech**: connect any OpenAI-compatible TTS server (Kokoro-FastAPI, openedai-speech) for a self-hosted companion voice with no API key. New "Local TTS" provider with voice, model, and base URL settings, plus a setup guide.

### Fixed
- Desktop app now reliably boots into the app on **macOS** (and all platforms). The previous launch raced on macOS WebKit; the window now opens directly into the app, with routing gated by a build-time flag so the landing page and docs are never reachable inside the desktop window.
- Info modal "Docs" link now points to the docs subdomain (docs.utsuwa.ai) and opens in the system browser on desktop.
- Info modal logo is now a clean mark (blue in light mode, white in dark) without the badge container.
- Desktop update notification now appears from the top of the window.
- OpenAI TTS now respects the selected model instead of always using `tts-1`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Desktop app now opens directly into the app instead of the marketing landing page.
- Landing, docs, and blog links inside the desktop app open in the system browser rather than navigating the app window.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Cross-platform desktop builds for **macOS, Windows, and Linux**, produced automatically by CI on each tagged release
- In-app auto-updates for the desktop app: a quiet check on launch, an unobtrusive update banner with download progress, and a manual "Check for updates" in the About dialog
- Tauri desktop application with transparent overlay mode (macOS, Windows, and Linux)
- Transparent overlay mode with always-on-top window
- Draggable companion character positioning
- Floating chat icon with expandable input bar
- Window switching between main app and overlay mode
- Platform detection layer (`isTauri()` / `isWeb()`)
- Global hotkey infrastructure (Ctrl+Shift shortcuts)
- Groq STT provider (Whisper) for voice input on all platforms including desktop

### Technical
