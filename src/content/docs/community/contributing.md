# Contributing

Contributions to Utsuwa are welcome. This page covers how to get set up and submit changes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- pnpm
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (only needed for desktop app development)

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/utsuwa.git
   cd utsuwa
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
6. For desktop development, run `pnpm tauri dev` instead (requires Rust)

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, create an issue with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (web or desktop, browser if web, OS, Node version)
- Screenshots if applicable

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. Create an issue with:

- A clear description of the feature
- The problem it solves or use case it addresses
- Any implementation ideas you have

## Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Run the quality gates; both must pass clean:
   ```bash
   pnpm test    # test suite (node --test)
   pnpm check   # type checking (svelte-check)
   ```
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit your changes with a clear message
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project
- Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) for reactivity
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
