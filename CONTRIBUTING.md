# Contributing to Utsuwa

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Utsuwa! Community PRs are welcome and reviewed with care. This document tells you what to expect and what gets a PR merged quickly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- pnpm
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (only needed for desktop app development)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/utsuwa.git
   cd utsuwa
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
6. For desktop development, run `pnpm tauri dev` instead (requires Rust)

## What Lands Quickly

A short list, learned from real PRs. Following it is the difference between one review round and three.

**One thing per PR.** A PR that bundles a feature, a refactor, and a settings change will be asked to split. Small focused PRs get reviewed fast; each piece moves at its own speed.

**Tests for pure logic.** The engine and helper modules are deliberately pure and testable, and CI runs the full suite on every PR. If you add or change a pure function (anything in `src/lib/engine/`, prompt building, parsing, budgets, truncation, dedup), add tests in the same PR. Pattern: `*.test.ts` next to the module, `node:test` runner, and relative imports need the `.ts` extension to run under `node --test`. Edge cases are first-class here: empty inputs, boundary values, and clock weirdness are exactly what the existing suites cover.

**Gating lives in the pipeline, not the UI.** Hiding a control for some providers does not scope the feature. If a setting should only apply to certain providers or platforms, enforce that where the value is consumed (the chat pipeline, the server route), not just where the checkbox renders. A hidden toggle that still fires is a bug.

**Don't change defaults out from under existing users.** If your change alters what happens for people who never touch your new setting (prompt composition, request parameters, truncation), call it out explicitly in the PR description, or better, make the old behavior the default.

**No fork-local configuration upstream.** Personal ignore rules, editor and tool files, and fork housekeeping belong in your fork (or `.git/info/exclude`), not in upstream `.gitignore`.

**Both provider surfaces, or neither.** Provider configuration currently renders in two places: onboarding (`ServicesStep`) and settings (`AiServicesSection`). Until they share components, a provider UI change should keep the two consistent. Say so in the PR if you deliberately did only one.

**Match the code around you.** TypeScript everywhere, Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`), design tokens instead of hardcoded colors (`var(--accent)`, not hex), and minimal comments that explain why, not what.

Before pushing:

```bash
pnpm check   # svelte-check, must be 0 errors 0 warnings
pnpm test    # full unit suite, must be green
```

CI runs both plus a Rust `cargo check` on every PR. A red check means no review until it's green.

## Adding a Provider Integration

LLM, TTS, and STT providers follow an established pattern. If you're adding or extending one:

- Default base URLs live in one place: `src/lib/services/providers/provider-defaults.ts`. Never duplicate a URL into a component or route.
- Local and self-hosted servers need base-URL normalization and origin handling like the existing Ollama and local-TTS integrations. Read one of those first and mirror it.
- Web builds route cloud calls through the SvelteKit server routes; desktop and local providers call directly. Your change usually needs both paths, and they must behave identically (including auth headers when there is no API key).
- Fixed cloud providers always use their official endpoint. User-supplied base URLs are for local and custom providers only.

## Scope and Content Decisions

Some changes are product decisions, not code decisions: anything that changes what Utsuwa ships in its prompts, how the project positions itself, or what the hosted deployment transmits. Open an issue to discuss before writing code, it saves everyone time.

One standing decision, so nobody has to rediscover it: **Utsuwa core does not ship content preambles or filter-override text.** The persona system prompt is fully user-editable, on the user's machine, in the user's words, and that is where tone and content boundaries belong. PRs that bundle preamble text into the app will be asked to convert to documentation instead.

## Review Expectations

- Reviews check correctness first (including edge cases and cross-file effects), then scoping, duplication, and consistency. Expect specific, actionable comments; expect to be asked for tests.
- `main` is production and moves fast, including maintainer refactors. If a refactor is about to touch an area your open PR changes, you'll get a heads-up in your PR thread; a rebase may still be needed. Rebasing promptly keeps your PR reviewable.
- Significant features should update docs in the same PR: `README.md` and, for anything touching the companion engine or memory, `src/content/docs/technology/companion-system.md`.
- Security issues: please report privately per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (web or desktop, browser if web, OS, Node version)
- Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please create an issue with:

- A clear description of the feature
- The problem it solves or use case it addresses
- Any implementation ideas you have

### Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch: `feature/your-feature-name`, `fix/description`, or `docs/description`
2. Make your changes, following the sections above
3. Run `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`
4. Use conventional commit style for the PR title (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`); PRs are squash-merged, so the title becomes the commit
5. Push to your fork and open the PR with a description of what changed and how you tested it

## Releases

Desktop binaries are built locally with Cargo; there is currently no installer pipeline (the previous Tauri-based release workflow was removed with `src-tauri/`):

```bash
pnpm build          # Frontend assets into build/
cargo build --release -p app-host
```

Packaging (`.dmg` / `.exe` / `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.rpm`) and any release automation need a new workflow.
